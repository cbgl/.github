This organisation features resources of CBGL, the Cumulative-Absolute-Error-per-Ray-based Global Localisation method. CBGL may localise a 2D LIDAR sensor in a map of its environment given one LIDAR measurement and the map.

- [cbgl](https://github.com/cbgl/cbgl) contains the source code
- [IROS-2024-paper](https://github.com/cbgl/IROS-2024-paper) contains the source tex of the paper accepted at the 2024 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems, held at Abu Dhabi, UAE
- [IROS-2024-presentations-resources](https://github.com/cbgl/IROS-2024-presentations-resources) contains the poster, pitch, graphical abstract, full presentation, and video illustration of CBGL's methodology and key properties
- [ros-experiments-src](https://github.com/cbgl/ros-experiments-src) contains the source C++ code of CBGL as well as state-of-the-art methods used to test their performance in global localisation with ROS
- [sim-experiments-src](https://github.com/cbgl/sim-experiments-src) contains the source C++ code of CBGL used to test its performance in global localisation with respect to varying scan--to--scan-matching methods and environment area
