This organisation features resources around **CBGL**, the Cumulative-Absolute-Error-per-Ray-based Global Localisation method. CBGL may localise a 2D LIDAR sensor in a map of its environment given a single LIDAR measurement and the map.

- [cbgl](https://github.com/cbgl/cbgl) contains the `roscpp` source code and `docker`-related files for building and deploying it
- [IROS-2024-paper](https://github.com/cbgl/IROS-2024-paper) contains the source `tex` code of the paper titled "CBGL: Fast Monte Carlo Passive Global Localisation
of 2D LIDAR Sensor", accepted at the 2024 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems, held at Abu Dhabi, UAE
- [IROS-2024-presentations-resources](https://github.com/cbgl/IROS-2024-presentations-resources) contains material for presenting CBGL, namely the poster and pitch required by IROS 2024, CBGL in graphical abstract form, its full presentation, and video illustration of its methodology and key properties
- [ros-experiments-src](https://github.com/cbgl/ros-experiments-src) contains the source `C++` code of CBGL as well as that of state-of-the-art methods that was used to test the methods' performance in global localisation with `ROS`, featured in the experimental evaluation section of the paper
- [sim-experiments-src](https://github.com/cbgl/sim-experiments-src) contains the source `C++` code of CBGL that was used to test its performance in global localisation with respect to varying scan--to--scan-matching methods and environment area, featured in the experimental evaluation and limitations sections of the paper
- [experiments-logs](https://github.com/cbgl/experiments-logs) contains raw data used to illustrate and support CBGL's contributions in the experimental evaluation, and characterisation and limitations sections of the paper
