This organisation features resources of **CBGL**, the Cumulative-Absolute-Error-per-Ray-based Global Localisation method. CBGL may localise a 2D LIDAR sensor in a map of its environment given only one LIDAR measurement and the map.

- [cbgl](https://github.com/cbgl/cbgl) contains the `roscpp` source code and `docker`-related files for building and deploying it
- [IROS-2024-paper](https://github.com/cbgl/IROS-2024-paper) contains the source `tex` code of the paper accepted at the 2024 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems, held at Abu Dhabi, UAE
- [IROS-2024-presentations-resources](https://github.com/cbgl/IROS-2024-presentations-resources) contains material for presenting CBGL, namely the poster and pitch required by IROS 2024, CBGL in graphical abstract form, its full presentation, and video illustration of its methodology and key properties
- [ros-experiments-src](https://github.com/cbgl/ros-experiments-src) contains the source C++ code of CBGL as well as that of state-of-the-art methods that can be used to test their performance in global localisation with ROS
- [sim-experiments-src](https://github.com/cbgl/sim-experiments-src) contains the source C++ code of CBGL that can be used to test its performance in global localisation with respect to varying scan--to--scan-matching methods and environment area
